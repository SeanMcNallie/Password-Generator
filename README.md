# Random Password Generator

## Description

This random password generator was created using JavaScript.  Start by pressing the Generate Password button.  It gives the user a choice of password length between 8-128.  The user is then prompted to make 4 choices about what they would like to include in the password.

1.	Would you like to have numbers in the password?
2.	Would you like to have symbols in the password?
3.	Would you like to have lowercase letters in your password?
4.	Would you like to have UPPERCASE letters in your password.

A random password is generated according to the userâ€™s choices.  If the user chooses none of the 4 choices, then a password is generated using all 4 choices.

The project was created to help me understand JavaScript better using arrays, random functions, push, prompts and other JavaScript tools.  I was given the HTML and CSS code.
